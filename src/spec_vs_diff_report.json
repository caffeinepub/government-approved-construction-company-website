  "summary": "Diff adds a bash packaging script plus an exclude list to generate a root-level project-source.zip, and adds an export guide markdown file. It also modifies project_state.json and frontend-file-summaries.txt, which are not part of the BuildRequest requirements. Documentation content appears truncated/incomplete in the provided diff excerpt, so REQ-2 cannot be fully verified.",

      "requirement": "Add clear, English documentation describing how to obtain and use the exported ZIP (how to unzip, install dependencies, run locally, and deploy to the Internet Computer).",
      "reason": "A documentation file was added, but in the provided truncated content it only clearly shows prerequisites and starts a 'Generating the Source ZIP' section; it does not show (in the available diff text) the required exact steps to unzip, install dependencies, start the frontend, and deploy with dfx, nor an explicit mention of backend/frontend folder structure.",
