  "summary": "Global theme tokens and Tailwind design tokens were updated (index.css + tailwind.config.js) and multiple key UI sections (Header, Footer, Home hero, card-heavy sections like Services/Projects) were adjusted to use token-driven styles and updated hover/active states. However, the new palette still appears to be strongly blue-forward (primary hues around 245–250), which may conflict with the requirement to avoid blue/purple as dominant colors. There are also unrequested user-facing copy changes in the Footer.",

      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Primary/secondary/accent/background/foreground/border colors are updated to a new cohesive palette and are not predominantly blue or purple.",
      "reason": "The updated global tokens explicitly set a deep steel blue as the light-mode primary and multiple tokens use hue values around ~245–250 (blue range), suggesting blue may still be dominant rather than reduced to a non-dominant role.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly frames this as a theme-only request and a non-goal is changing existing user-facing copy/content beyond what’s required to support the theme update; the diff shows new/updated sentences in the Footer.",
