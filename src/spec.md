# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the site-wide visual theme to a new professional, trustworthy, industrial look by changing global design tokens, avoiding blue/purple as dominant colors.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global design tokens (colors, typography, radius, shadows) in a single source of truth so changes apply across the entire site in light and dark modes.
- Adjust shared layout and key sections (Header, Footer, Home hero, and card-heavy sections) to use token-driven styling and replace any hardcoded color classes that conflict with the new theme.
- Validate interactive states (hover/active/focus) for navigation links, buttons, badges, and cards to ensure consistent appearance and readable contrast.

**User-visible outcome:** The website displays a noticeably refreshed industrial theme across all pages, with consistent colors and components (including header, footer, hero, and cards) that remain readable and visually cohesive in both light and dark mode.
